        <p> 
          FranceÂ´s second city is a diverse melting pot of people and cultures that all call Marseille their home. 
          Traditionally thought of as grimy and a bit run-down, this bustling port city has undergone something 
          of a renaissance in recent years, though its primary attractions remain the same.
          <br>
          The old harbor, for instance, is a magical setting from which to watch fishermen returning to shore with their catch.
           It is the heart of Marseille, and youÂ´ll really get a feel for the city here. The oldest neighborhood, Le Panier,
            is definitely worth checking out, as is the stunning Notre Dame de Major cathedral that overlooks the sea.

            <p>
              Les Calanques are a series of miniature fjords to the south of Marseille near Cassis. 
              The narrow inlets are encased in steep walls made of limestone or dolomite, and are highly scenic.
               Hiking even a portion of the rocky cliffs above the Mediterranean Sea and its fjords can take a day,
                with foot access restricted in summer due to extreme heat, while cruising through the inlets can be done in a couple of hours.
                 Samna, south of Marseille, is considered a must-see calanque; it has a rocky beach and is popular with scuba divers

        <p>
          An observation post has sat atop Garde Hill since the 15th century. It was followed by a fort, which later served as the foundation 
          for the basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde. Today, a large statue of the Virgin Mary sits atop the bell tower watching over sailors,
           fishermen and this port city; it is one of Marseilleâ€™ landmarks. A sanctuary inside the church is also devoted to the Virgin Mary, 
           whose feast day is celebrated August 5. The basilica is a popular destination for pilgrims.

          The Old Port, or Vieux Port, is a natural harbor that has seen use since the ancient Greek founded Marseille 2,400 years ago, 
          though it now serves mainly as a popular tourist attraction. At one time, 18,000 ships a year berthed at the Old Port. 
          Old Port is made for pleasant strolling and relaxing over a glass of wine at a sidewalk cafÃ©. St. 
          Victorâ€™s Abbey, one of the oldest Christian churches in France, is located here, as is the lighthouse,
           the Phare de Sainte Marie and the Roman Dock Museum.

    <p class="bold"><ins>  1. Fourviere Basilica : </ins></p> <br>
    <p>aDominating Lyonâ€™s â€œHill of Prayer,â€ the FourviÃ¨re, the Basilica of Notre-Dame de FourviÃ¨re was built
       in the late 19th century from a design by architect Pierre Bossan. The architecture of the church is unique
        in that it has both Byzantine and Romanesque styles. In addition to four corner towers rising over the structure,
         the basilica features a bell tower with a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. The upper sanctuary of the church is ornamented with
          mosaics and stained glass. Visitors can take a funicular to the site from the metro station in Vieux Lyon or can climb the steep
           ascent to the summit of Fourviere Hill on foot.

<br>
<p>     
  With beginnings that date back to the 13th century, the Place des Terreaux located in the Presquâ€™Ã®le district has long played an important role in Lyonâ€™s history.

  the central square is today bordered by the Lyon City Hall to the east and the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon on the south. On the north side of the square is a fountain designed
