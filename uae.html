        <h2>Ras Al Khaimah</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Ras Al-Khaimah is many Dubai locals' top escape from the city. The United Arab Emirates' most northern region, Ras Al-Khaimah is backed by the mighty Hajar Mountains, which roll down to the shore dramatically, making this a great base for exploring and sightseeing in a rugged area.
          <br><br>
          Historically, this region is very important, with archaeological excavations here revealing that this area has been inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. The Ras Al-Khaimah National Museum does an excellent job of explaining this long-reaching history.
          <br><br>
          Although much of the city is modern, the wonderfully atmospheric Jazirat al-Hamra area is a major tourist attraction as it gives a taste of the peaceful Emirati life of the pearl divers and fishermen before the mid-20th-century oil boom. Find out more about the best places to visit with our list of the top attractions in Ras Al-Kaimah.   
          <br><br>
          <span>Places to visit:</span> 
          <br>
          <span>Jebel Jais</span> 

          About 55 kilometers northeast of Ras Al-Khaimah, Jebel Jais, part of the Hajar Mountain Range, is the United Arab Emirates' tallest mountain, with its summit at 1,934 meters. A recently opened 20-kilometer-long road to the top (not quite to the summit) snakes in a switchback all the way up the mountain's flank, with viewing platforms along the route to take in the beautiful far-reaching vistas.
          <br><br>
          Near the top of the road, a series of landscaped terraces with viewing platforms and cafes offer up spectacular views that tumble over craggy peaks down to the coastal plain, making this prime territory for photographers, particularly in the late afternoon when the orange-hued rocks glow. 
          <br><br>
          <span>Ras Al-Khaimah Beaches</span>
          
          Ras Al-Khaimah has plenty for sun seekers and relaxation fans. The emirate's long shoreline is strung with luxury resorts all offering their own private patch of golden sand. Most will also allow non-guests to use their facilities with a day pass. The beaches are well cared for and packed with facilities, including sun loungers, sun shades, cafes and restaurants right on the sand, freshwater showers, and pretty much everything you need for a day of topping up your tan. Various water sports are also on offer, including kayak hire and jet-skis.
          <br>
          <span>Jebel Jais Flight Zipline</span> 

          The world's longest zipline (stretching for 2.8 kilometers) on Jebel Jais has become one of the United Arab Emirates' major adventure activities and a main draw for adrenaline junkies visiting the country. From the take-off point, near the summit of Jebel Jais, the zipline whips down the mountain, with zipliners traveling at speeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour. As well as the thrill of the flight itself and the stupendous mountain scenery, a major highlight is landing on the halfway platform, which is suspended in mid-air.
          <br><br>
          <span>Ras Al-Khaimah National Museum</span>

          The Ras Al-Khaimah National Museum is in a fort that was the residence of the ruling family up until the early 1960s. The museum houses an excellent collection of archaeological and ethnological artifacts.
          <br><br>
          The Qawasim Room on the first floor is particularly interesting, with a collection of documents, manuscripts, and treaties between the rulers of Ras Al-Khaimah and Great Britain. There are also exhibits of traditional weapons belonging to the ruling family, as well as archaeological displays about the earliest settlers in the area up to the late Islamic period. The museum's ethnographic section introduces traditional life in the emirate, including architecture, pearl diving, date growing, farming, and fishing. 
          <br><br>
          <span>Dhayah Fort</span>

          This 16th-century mud-brick fort, about 20 kilometers north of Ras Al-Khaimah city, was built in a strategic hilltop position facing the gulf to defend the region from attack by the British. As a defensive military tower, the Dhayah Fort played an important role in the history of Ras Al-Khaimah.
          <br><br>
          Other ruined fortifications and watchtowers can be seen to the south of the hill. A battle in 1891 between the emirate and British forces resulted in the destruction of much of the fortifications here. The panoramic views from the fort's ramparts are well worth the trip here, and for anyone interested in history, exploring the fort itself is one of this small emirate's top things to do.
