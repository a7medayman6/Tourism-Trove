            <h2>About Japan</h2>
            <hr><br>
            <p>
              Japan is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south.
              <br><br>
              A successful fusion of the modern and the ancient, Japan has managed to maintain age-old traditions while becoming one of the most advanced and modern countries in the world. A trip to Japan means to experience a complete and utterly different culture and to surrender yourself to the unfamiliar.
              <br><br>
              The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the land surface consisting of mountains. There are many active and dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji (Fuji-san), which, at an elevation of 12,388 feet (3,776 metres), is Japan’s highest mountain. Abundant precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout most of the country have produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite the mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it possible to raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a great extent, ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily concentrated in the low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of Honshu.
              <br><br>
              Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a country possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet one that, since 1950, has emerged as one of the world’s most economically and technologically advanced societies. Heavy emphasis is placed on education, and Japan is one of the world’s most literate countries. Tension between old and new is apparent in all phases of Japanese life. A characteristic sensitivity to natural beauty and a concern with form and balance are evident in such cities as Kyōto and Nara, as well as in Japan’s ubiquitous gardens. Even in the countryside, however, the impact of rapid Westernization is evident in many aspects of Japanese life. The agricultural regions are characterized by low population densities and well-ordered rice fields and fruit orchards, whereas the industrial and urbanized belt along the Pacific coast of Honshu is noted for its highly concentrated population, heavy industrialization, and environmental pollution.

          <h2>Tokyo</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Tokyo, the buzzing capital city of Japan and one of the best places to visit in Asia, is also home to the Imperial Palace and the seat of Government and Parliament. Located in East-Central Honshu, the largest of Japan's main islands, this heavily populated city is well worth visiting, and serves as a great base from which to explore other parts of the country.
            <br><br>
            One of the world's most modern cities in terms of its infrastructure and design - due largely to the 1923 earthquake and the devastation of WWII - Tokyo also holds the title of the world's most expensive city in which to live. Fortunately, it's also one of the easiest to get around thanks to its superb rail and subway networks.
            <br><br>
            The cultural side of Tokyo is famous for its numerous things to do and top attractions, including museums; festivals; internationally noted cuisine; and professional sports clubs, including baseball, football, and traditional Japanese pursuits like sumo wrestling. It's also a city rich in music and theater, with numerous venues featuring everything from Japanese to modern dramas, symphony orchestras, and pop and rock concerts. 
            <br><br>
            <span>Places to visit:</span>  
            <br>
            <span>The Imperial Palace</span> 
            The chief attraction of Tokyo's Marunouchi district is the Imperial Palace (Kōkyo) with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats. Still in use by the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace stands on the site where, in 1457, the Feudal Lord Ota Dokan built the first fortress, the focal point from which the city of Tokyo (or Edo, as it was then) gradually spread.
            <br><br>
            As famous as the palace is the Nijubashi Bridge leading to its interior, a structure that takes its name ("double bridge") from its reflection in the water. Other notable features include the two-meter-thick wall surrounding the palace and its gates, one of which leads to the East Higashi-Gyoen Garden. 
            <br>
            <span>Ginza District</span>
            Ginza is Tokyo's busiest shopping area and it's as iconic as Times Square in New York, and much older. It has in fact been the commercial center of the country for centuries, and is where five ancient roads connecting Japan's major cities all met. Lined by exclusive shops and imposing palatial stores, the Ginza district is also fun to simply wander around or. Better still, sit in one of its many tea and coffee shops or restaurants while watching the world rush past.
            <br><br>
            At weekends, when everything is open, it's a shopper's paradise as traffic is barred, making it one of the world's largest pedestrian zones. Come nightfall, gigantic advertising panels on its many buildings bathe Ginza in bright neon light.
            <br><br>
            It's also where you'll find the famous Kabuki-za Theatre (see #12 below), home to traditional Kabuki performances, as well as the Shinbashi Enbujō Theatre in which Azuma-odori dances and Bunraku performances are staged.
            <br>
            <span>Sensō-ji Temple</span> 
            In the Asakusa district of Tokyo, the exquisite Sensō-ji Temple (Kinryū-zan Sensō-ji)) - the city's most famous shrine - stands at the end of a long street market hosting vendors selling masks, carvings, combs made of ebony and wood, toys, kimonos, fabrics, and precious paper goods.
            <br><br>
            Dedicated to Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of compassion, the temple was established in AD 645 and retains its original appearance despite having been rebuilt numerous times.
            <br><br>           
            Highlights of a visit include seeing the Kaminari-mon Gate with its 3.3-meter-high red paper lantern bearing the inscription "Thunder Gate," as well as the famous and much-loved Incense Vat, reputed to drive away ailments (you'll see people cupping their hands around the smoke and applying it to the part of their body needing healing).     
            <br>
            <span>Ueno Park and Zoo</span>
            A paradise-like oasis of green in the heart of busy Tokyo, Ueno Park (Ueno Kōen) is the city's largest green space and one of its most popular tourist attractions. In addition to its lovely grounds, the park also boasts numerous temples and museums to explore.
            <br><br>
            Criss-crossed by pleasant gravel paths, this 212-acre park includes highlights such as a trip on a small boat on the reed-fringed Shinobazu pond, around a little island with its Bentendo Temple. Be sure to also visit the 17th-century Toshogu Shrine (Nikkō Tōshō-gū), with its 256 bronze and stone lanterns.
            <br><br>
            Another highlight here is Ueno Zoo (Onshi Ueno Dōbutsuen). Opened in 1882, it is Japan's oldest zoo, and is famous for the pandas presented by the People's Republic of China.

        <h2>Kyoto</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Surrounded by the hills of central Honshu, Kyoto is one of Japan's largest cities. It's also the educational hub of western Japan and boasts several universities and higher educational establishments. Although one of Japan's great tourist destinations, it is famous for having preserved much of the atmosphere of the past, having been the only major Japanese city to escape the devastation of WWII.
          <br><br>
          Celebrated as the residence of the Emperor, and Japan's principal cultural center for almost 1,100 years, Kyoto today boasts numerous things to do and great places to visit, including exploring the fine examples of sculptures, paintings, and other art forms in its many museums and galleries. 
          <br><br>
          Kyoto continues to play an important role in Japanese religion, with 30 of the city's temples still serving as centers of various Buddhist sects, along with some 200 Shinto shrines within the city limits. All told, UNESCO World Heritage Site status has been designated to 17 historic buildings in Kyoto. 
          <br><br>
          <span>Places to visit:</span>
          <br>
          <span>Nijo Castle</span>
          Nijo Castle (Nijō-jō), complete with well-preserved walls, towers, and a moat, was built in 1603 and later served as the seat of government. The complex has several buildings containing many significant works of art, and is famous as the location chosen by the emperor to issue the rescript abolishing the country's once powerful Shogunate.
          <br><br>
          Highlights include the castle's East Gate (Higashi Otemon, its main entrance), as well as the Inner Gate, or Karamon, notable for its fine carvings and decorated metalwork. Beyond this, the elaborate Mikuruma-yose is another must-see. The castle's fine gardens are also fun to explore.
          <br><br>
          The site's most important building is Ninomaru Palace. Consisting of five separate buildings linked by corridors, it boasts exquisite interiors decorated with many paintings by Kano Tanyu and his pupils. The principal apartment is the Hall of the Imperial Emissary (Jodan-no-ma), matched in splendor by the adjoining rooms, Ni-no-ma and Tozamurai-no-ma with their paintings of tigers. 
          <br>
          <span>Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine</span>
          One of Japan's most famous shrines, the Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine is a must-visit when in Kyoto. Founded in AD 711 and dedicated to the goddess of rice-growing, Ukanomitama-no-mikoto, the shrine is still frequented by merchants and tradesmen who pray for prosperity.
          <br><br>
          The main building dates from 1499 and features a spectacular four-kilometer-long avenue of bright orange "torii," or arches, each dedicated by a business (it takes some two-hours to travel past the 1,000 arches lining the route). Also notable are its many sculptures of foxes, reputed to be messengers of the gods. 
          <br>
          <span>Kinkaku-ji: The Golden Pavilion</span>
          Originally built in the 14th century as a retirement villa for Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and now a Zen Buddhist temple, the magnificent Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji) is one of Kyoto's most picturesque attractions.
          <br><br>
          Taking its name from the gold leaf adorning the top two of its three floors - a design element believed to alleviate any negativity associated with death - the structure has been rebuilt in its original form a number of times, this most recent incarnation dating from the late 1950s.
          <br><br>
          Built over a large pond, the site is also famous for its beautiful grounds, as well as its old stone pagoda and the Sekkatei Teahouse with its traditionally served beverages. For a different perspective of this wonderful tourist attraction, plus avoiding the summer crowds, time your visit for either winter or autumn (the latter is spectacular thanks to the fall colors).

    <div class="about-cities" >
      <div class="content-about-section">
        <h2>Hakone</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Hakone (箱根) is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, less than one hundred kilometers from Tokyo.
          <br><br>
          Famous for hot springs, natural beauty and the view across Lake Ashinoko of nearby Mount Fuji, Hakone is one of the most popular destinations among Japanese and international tourists looking for a break from Tokyo.
          <br><br>
          It’s no secret that Hakone is one of the most popular and accessible day trip destinations from Tokyo, together with Kawaguchiko (Mount Fuji), Kamakura, Yokohama or even Tochigi.
          <br><br>
          <span>Places to visit:</span> 
          <br>
          <span>Queen Ashinoko</span> 
          Taking the sightseeing cruise in Lake Ashi is like covering two of Hakone’s iconic attractions in one. Cruise along Lake Ashi in this Disney-esque pirate ship from Moto-Hakone Boat Pier to Togendai-ko Station — with a new ship joining the lineup!
          <br><br>
          In addition to the Vasa, Victory and Royal II ships, the 541-seater Queen Ashinoko will start its service from 25 April 2019. What’s unique about this ship is its floor-to-ceiling wooden interior and a gold-painted hull, giving off a majestic glow that reflects against the water surface. Basically Pirates of the Caribbean, but 100 times fancier.
          <br>
          <span>Hakone Open Air Museum</span>
          The Hakone Open Air Museum is Japan’s first ever outdoor art museum of any sort, and experienced Japan travellers might liken this to Niigata’s Echigo-Tsumari Art Field with a similar concept where artworks are surrounded by mountains and nature.
          <br><br>
          This 70,000 square metre space houses over 100 modern and contemporary pieces, as well as an indoor exhibition selected from 300 of Picasso’s collection! Perhaps the centrepiece of it all is the Symphonic Sculpture by Gabriel Loire (pictured above) that’s actually a spiral staircase within a stained glass column, leading to an observatory on top with panoramic views of the park and mountains.
          <br>
          <span>Hakone Shrine</span> 
          This grand torii gate is usually the starting point for everyone’s Hakone itinerary. This famous “floating” gate isn’t even the actual shrine! The actual Hakone shrine complex behind it is huge — with flights upon flights of stairs to boot — so if you’re only doing a day trip you may be better off giving the shrine a miss. Otherwise, exploring the whole complex could easily take you two hours or more.
          <br>  
          <span>Gora Park</span>
          The Gora Park lies on a steep slope above the Gora station. This is a western-style garden designed to relax and relish the beautiful scenery of Hakone.
          <br><br>
          Interestingly although the park lies in Japan, it is designed in the French style. The park has a fountain and a rose garden. Also, the park holds two greenhouses, first one holds a tropical botanical garden, and the other one contains a flower garden. If you overlook the fountain you will find a restaurant to satiate your hunger, and there is a teahouse too called Hakuun-do Chain.
          <br><br>
          The park arranges various activities as well, like glass blowing, pottery, glass etching, and dried flower arrangement. Visitors can join for these activities happening in the Crafthouse situated in the park.
