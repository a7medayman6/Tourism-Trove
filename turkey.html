    <p class="bold"><ins>  1) Sedir Island: </ins></p> <br>
    <p>also known as Cleopatra Island, is a small island in the Gulf of Gökova of southeastern Aegean Sea off
     the coast of Ula, part of Muğla Province of Turkey. It is famous for its beach made from seashells. 
     It is said that this organic sand was brought by ships from the Red Sea especially for Cleopatra. 
     Each grain of sand is a perfect sphere, for this reason the beach is heavily protected by the government 
     to prevent any sand being removed from the beach. According to legend, Anthony and Cleopatra swam here 
     and the sands were brought by ships from North Africa. It has been said that this type of sand can only be found in Egypt.

    DAbove the river's sheer cliffs are the weathered façades of Lycian tombs cut from rock, 
    circa 400 BC (36°50′1.09″N 28°38′3.16″E). The ruins of the ancient trading city of Kaunos
     are a short boat trip across the river.
    The south of Dalyan on the Mediterranean coast, lies İztuzu Beach, near the village of the same 
    name is a popular area for sunbathing and swimming. There are regular boat and minibus (dolmuş)
     services to the beach. Visitors should be aware of the wooden stakes in the beach to mark nesting sites.
      The road route is particularly scenic, offering views of Sülüngür Lake. In 2008 İztuzu Beach was proclaimed
       winner in the category Best Open Space (Europe) by The Times because of the eco-friendly exploitation of the beach.
        In 2011 Dalyan and İztuzu Beach were proclaimed Best Beach Destination of Europe by Dutch holiday assessment website Zoover.
